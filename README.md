# EWP - Event Wallet Passport
## Made by me & https://github.com/TyyyCardoso
### What is EWP
- This website was developed for a fictitious business of advertising and selling tickets for events (festivals and others).
- The user have 2 different roles (client or enterprise).
- Client create is own account and can see and buy tickets.
- Enterprise can create their own events and add different type of tickets to them

The main porpuse of this repo made with ASP.NET MVC was only the back-end to treat all the data, but was made a front-end too, later.
